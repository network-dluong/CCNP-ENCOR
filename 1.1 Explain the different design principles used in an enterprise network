	Hierarchical LAN Design Model
•	Divides enterprise network architecture into modular layers with each layer implementing specific functions
•	Simplifies network design and provides easy way to scale the network as well as consistent deployment method
•	Provides fault containment by constraining network changes to a subset of the network

1.	Access Layer (network edge) – gives endpoints and users direct access to network
  a.	Provides high-bandwidth device connectivity using wired and wireless access technologies
  b.	Can be segmented so different devices can be placed into different logical networks for performance, management, and security
  c.	Communication between endpoints on different access layer switches occurs through distribution layer (access layer switches not interconnected with another)
  
2.	Distribution Layer – provides an aggregation point for access layer and acts as a service and control boundary between access layer and core layer
  a.	Layer 2 side – creates boundary for SPT, limiting propagation of Layer 2 faults
  b.	Layer 3 side – provides logical point to summarize IP routing information when it enters the core of the network. Reduces IP routing tables for easier troubleshooting, and reduces protocol overhead for faster recovery from failures
  c.	Often deployed in pairs for redundancy
  
3.	Core Layer (backbone) - provides connections between distribution layers for large environments
  a.	Provides high-speed connectivity for large enterprises with multiple campus networks distributed worldwide
  b.	Provides interconnectivity between end-user/endpoint campus access layer and other network blocks (data center, cloud, WAN, Internet edge, network services)
  c.	Reduces network complexity, from N x (N – 1) to N links for N distributions
