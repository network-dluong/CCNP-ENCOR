### Virtual machine  
* Software emulation of a physical server with an OS  
* Sandboxed from the rest of the system  
* Virtual hardware is mapped to real hardware on the physical machine  
* Includes guest OS which comes with large number of components that are not required for the application to run  


### Container  
* An isolated environment where containerized applications run, not the same as VMs  
* Share underlying resources of host OS and do not include guest OS; lightweight  
* Container image â€“ file created by container engine that includes the application code along with its dependencies, easy to move/migrate  
* Rkt, Open Container Initiative, LXD, Linux-VServer, Windows Containers
