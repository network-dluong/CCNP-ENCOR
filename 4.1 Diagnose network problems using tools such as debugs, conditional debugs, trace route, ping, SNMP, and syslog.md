## Ping  
* Gather facts – know what the IP address information for the remote site router or device is  
* Test reachability:  
> **ping (*ip address*)**  
* Record outcome:  
  * Success = not related to basic reachability   
  * Unsuccessful = check interface issues, routing issues, access lists, or intermediate firewalls  
* **!!!!!** = all 5 pings successful  
* If Source Interface is used, interface name must be spelled out and not abbreviated  
* Defaults = 5 pings, 100 bytes size, 0 probe, 0xABCD data pattern  


## Traceroute  
* Used to determine where traffic is failing as well as what path traffic takes throughout the network  
* Shows IP addresses or DNS names of hops between source and destination  
* Shows how long it takes to reach destination at each hop, measured in milliseconds  
* Unsuccessful = missing route or mistyped destination  
* Defaults = 3 seconds timeout, 3 probes, 30 hops, port 33434  


## Debugging  
* Need to see things at a deeper level  
* Common OSPF adjacency issues – MTU issues, incorrect interface types, and improperly configured network mask  


## Conditional debugging  
* Limits scope of messages that are being returned to the console or syslog server  
> **Debug ip packet {(1-199) | (1300-2699)} detail**  
* Standard ACL - (1-199), Extended ACL - (1300-2699)  
* Can debug on a specific interface  


## Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)  
* Reactive alerting from network devices, such as something failing or certain events happening on a device  
* Can also be used to configure devices  
* SNMP sends unsolicited traps to SNMP collector or Network Management System (NMS)  
* Evens are defined in SNMP Management Information Base (MIB), a repository of device parameters that can be used to trigger alerts  
* SNMPv2c: Community strings are read-only (RO) or read/write (RW)  
* Sending traps to an NMS:  
1. Define SNMP host or NMS to send traps to  
2. Create an access list to restrict access via SNMP:  
> **access-list 99 permit (*ip address*) (*inv subnet*)**  
3. Define read-only community string:  
> **snmp-server community (*string*) ro 99**  
4. Define read/write community string:  
> **snmp-server community (*string*) rw 99**  
5. Define SNMP location  
6. Define SNMP contact  
> **SNMP-server enable traps (trap)**  
> **SNMP-server host (*ip address*) (*trap*) READONLY**  


## Syslog  
* By default, all syslog messages are sent to the console  
* Can be sent to logging buffer or off-box syslog collector, UDP 514  
* Date and time of the clock must be properly configured for accurate time, or the time stamps on all logging messages will not reflect appropriate and accurate time (NTP)  
* Emergencies – 0, Alerts – 1, Critical – 2, Errors – 3, Warnings – 4, Notifications – 5, Informational – 6, Debugging – 7  
1. Enable logging to the buffer:  
> **logging buffer (0-7) or (*severity*)**  
2. Set severity level of syslog messages to send to buffer  
3. Set logging buffer to a larger size:  
> **logging buffer (*bytes*)**
