### VRF (Virtual Routing and Forwarding)  
* Creates separate virtual routers on a physical router  
* Allows for interaction and segmentation with Layer 3 dynamic routing protocols  
* Router interfaces, routing tables, and forwarding tables are isolated between VRFs, preventing traffic from one VRF from forwarding into another VRF  
* All router interfaces belong to global VRF until specifically assigned to user defined VRF, and global VRF is identical to regular routing table of non-VRF routers  
* VRF creates segmentation between network interfaces, network sub-interfaces, IP address, and routing tables  
* To configure VRF:  
1. Create multiprotocol VRF:  
> **vrf definition (*vrf-name*)**  
2. Initialize appropriate address family (IPv4, IPv6, or both):  
> **address-family {ipv4 | ipv6}**  
3. Enter interface configuration sub-mode and specify interface to be associated with VRF instance:  
> **interface (*int-id*)**  
4. Associate VRF instance to interface or sub-interface under interface configuration sub-mode:  
> **vrf forwarding (*vrf-name*)**  
5. Configure an IP address on interface or sub-interface by either:  
> IPv4 – **ip address (*ip address*) (*subnet-mask*) [secondary]**  
> IPv6 – **ipv6 address (*ipv6-address/prefix-length*)**
