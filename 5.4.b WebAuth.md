## Authenticating with WebAuth  
* WebAuth presents the end user with content to read and interact with before granting access to the network (Acceptable Use Policy, entering user credentials)  
* Can be used as an additional layer with Open Authentication, PSK, and EAP  
* Can be handled locally on the WLC for smaller environments through Local Web Authentication (LWA)  
  * LWA with an internal database on WLC  
  * LWA with an external database on RADIUS or LDAP server  
  * LWA with an external redirect after authentication  
  * LWA with an external splash page redirect, using an internal database on WLC  
  * LWA with passthrough, requiring user acknowledgement  
* Central Web Authentication (CWA) uses LWA with an external database on a RADIUS server (ISE) and keeps user databased centralized
