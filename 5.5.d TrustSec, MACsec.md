### Cisco TrustSec  
* Next-generation access control enforcement solution to address the growing operation challenges related to maintaining firewall rules and ACLs by using SGT tags  
* It uses SGT tags to perform ingress tagging and egress filtering to enforce AC policy  
* SGT tags represent the contect of the user, device, use case, or function  
* Ingress classification – process of assigning SGT tags to users, endpoints, or other resources by: Dynamic or Static assignment  
* Propagation – process of communicating the mappings to the TrustSec network device that will enforce policy based on SGT tags by: Inline tagging (native tagging), or SXP propagation (TCP based)  
* Egress Enforcement – enforces traffic based on the SGT tag by: Security Group ACL (SGACL), or Security Group Firewall (SGFW)  


### MACsec  
* IEEE 802.1AE standards-based Layer 2 hop-by-hop encryption method  
* Traffic is encrypted only on the wire between two MACsec peers and is unencrypted as it is processed internally within the switch  
* Leverages onboard ASICs to perform encryption and decryption rather than having to offload to a crypto engine (IPsec)  
* Additional 16-byte MACsec Security Tag field (802.1AE header) and 16-byte Integrity Check Value (ICV) are added  
* Provides authentication using Galois Method Authentication Code (GMAC), or authenticated encryption using Galois/Counter Mode Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-GCM)  
* Two MACsec keying mechanisms: Security Association Protocol (SAP), and MACsec Key Agreement (MKA) protocol  
* Downlink MACsec – describes the encrypted link between an endpoint and a switch  
* Uplink MACsec – term for encrypting a link between switches with 802.1AE (Cisco SAP by default)
