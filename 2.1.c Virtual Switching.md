### Virtual Switching	 
* Software-based Layer 2 switch that operates like a physical Ethernet switch  
* Allows communication between virtual machines through hypervisor, but network traffic cannot flow directly from one vSwitch to another within the same host and cannot share the same pNIC  
* Intelligently directs communication on a network by checking data packets before moving to a destination  
* Distributed switching: centralized management for multiple hosts which simplifies administration, networking statistics and policies migration with VMs, and configuration consistency  
* Docker â€“ default virtual bridge called Docker0 and subnet 172.17.0.1/16. Use Kubernetes to manage and scale containers
