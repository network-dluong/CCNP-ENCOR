## Cisco Talos  
* Cisco threat intelligence organization, created from IronPort Security Applications (SecApps), The Sourcefire Vulnerability Research Team (VRT), and The Cisco Threat Research, Analysis, and Communications team (TRAC)  


## Cisco Threat Grid  
* Solution that can perform static file analysis (filenames, MD5 checksums, file types) as well as dynamic file analysis (behavioral analysis) by running files in a controlled and monitored sandbox environment  
* Observe and analyze behavior against millions of samples and billions of malware artifacts to determine if it is malware  
* Available as an appliance and in the cloud, and also integrated into existing Cisco security products and third-party solutions  


## Cisco Advanced Malware Protection (AMP)  
* Malware analysis and protection solution that goes beyond point-in-time detection  
* **Before**: global threat intelligence from Cisco Talos and Cisco Threat Grid feeds into AMP to protect against known and emerging threats  
* **During**: file reputation to determine whether a file is clean or malicious as well as sandboxing are used to identify threats during an attack  
* **After**: Cisco AMP provides retrospection, indicators of compromise (IoCs), breach detection, tracking, analysis, and surgical remediation after an attack, when advanced malware has slipped past other defenses  
* AMP Cloud (private or public), AMP connectors (Endpoints, Networks, Email, Web, Meraki MX), Threat intelligence from Cisco Talos and Cisco Threat Grid  
* If file is malicious, it is stored in the cloud and reported to AMP connectors. If unknown, it is sent to Threat Grid  


## Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client  
* Modular endpoint software product that is a VPN client that provides VPN access through TLS/SSL and IPsec IKEv2, and offers enhanced security through various built-in modules  
* If an endpoint is noncompliant, network access can be restricted  
* Includes Cisco Cloud Web Security, Stealthwatch, and Cisco Umbrella  


## Cisco Umbrella  
* Provides first line of defense against threats on the Internet by blocking requests to malicious Internet destinations using DNS before an IP connection is established or a file is downloaded  
* 100% cloud delivered, with no hardware to install or software to maintain  
* Includes 30 data centers using Anycast DNS with 100% uptime  


## Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA)  
* All-in-one web gateway that includes a wide variety of protections, can block hidden malware from suspicious and legitimate websites  
* Leverages real-time threat intelligence from Cisco Talos and Cisco AMP Threat Grid  
* Provides multiple layers of malware defense and vital data loss prevention (DLP) capabilities across the full attack continuum  
* **Before an Attack**: filters and controls web application usage: Web reputation filters, Web filtering, Cisco Application Visibility and Control (AVC)  
* **During an Attack**: identifies and blocks zero-day threats: Cloud access security, Parallel antivirus (AV) scanning, Layer 4 traffic monitoring, File reputation and analysis with Cisco AMP, DLP  
* **After an Attack**: inspects network continuously for instances of undetected malware and breaches  
* Can be deployed in the cloud, as a virtual appliance, on-premises, or in a hybrid arrangement  

## Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA)  
* Enables users to communicate securely via email and helps organizations combat email security threats with a multilayered approach across the attack continuum  
* Global threat intelligence, Reputation filtering, Spam protection, Forged email detection, Cisco Advanced Phishing Protection (CAPP), Cisco Domain Protection (CDP), Malware defense, Graymail detection and Safe Unsubscribe, URL-related protection and control, Outbreak filters, Web interaction tracking, Data security for sensitive content in outgoing emails  

## Next-Generation Intrusion Prevention System (NGIPS)  
* Passively monitors and analyzes network traffic for potential network intrusion attacks and logs the data for security analysis  
* Real-time contextual awareness, Advanced threat protection, Intelligent security automation, Unparalleled performance and scalability, Application visibility and control (AVC) and URL filtering  
* Cisco Firepower: Centralized management, Global threat intelligence from Cisco Talos, Snort IPS detection engine, High availability and clustering, Third-party and open-source ecosystem, Integration with Cisco ISE  
* Firepower series appliances, Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) for ISR, NGIPS Virtual (NGIPSv)
