### MAC address table  
* Responsible for identifying switch ports and VLANs with which a device is associated  
* **Show mac address-table [address (*mac-address*) | dynamic | vlan (*vlan-id*)]**  
  * **address (*mac-address*)** – displays entries that match explicit MAC address  
  * **Dynamic** – displays entries that are dynamically learned and are not statically set or burned in on switch  
  * **vlan (*vlan-id*)** – displays entries that matches specified VLAN  
* Adding manual entry with ability to associate to specific switch port or drop traffic upon receipt – mac address-table static mac-address vlan (id) [drop | interface (id)]  
* Flush MAC address table for entire switch – **clear mac address-table dynamic [{address (*mac-address*) | interface (*int-id*) | vlan (*vlan-id*)}]**  
* Table resides in CAM – uses high-speed memory faster than typical computer RAM  
* CAB table provides binary result for any query of 0 is true and 1 is false  


### TCAM  
* Allows for matching and evaluation of a packet on more than one field  
* Extension of CAM but enhanced to allow for upper-layer processing  
* Provides more flexibility in searching with three results: 0 for true, 1 for false, and X for do not care  
* Stored in Value, Mask, and Result (VMR) format:  
  * Value – fields that should be searched (IP address, protocol)  
  * Mask – field that is of interest and should be queried  
  * Result – action that should be taken with match on value and mask  
* Operates in hardware – provides faster processing and scalability than process switching
