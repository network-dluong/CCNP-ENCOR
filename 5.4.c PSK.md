## PSK (Pre-Shared Key)  
* WPA, WPA2, WPA3 - specifies encryption and data integrity methods to protect data passing over wireless connections  
* All WPA versions support PSK (Personal Mode) or 802.1x (Enterprise Mode)  
* **Personal Mode** - key string must be shared or configured on every client and AP before clients connect to wireless network  
  * Clients and APs work through a four-way handshake that uses the PSK key string to construct and exchange encryption key material that can be openly exchanged  
  * When process is successful, AP can authenticate client, and they can secure data frames that are sent over the air  
  * WPA/WPA2-Personal modes are not recommended as the four-way handshake can be captured  
  * WPA3-Personal strengthens key exchange between clients and APs through *Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE)*. Also offers forward secrecy which prevents attackers from using a key to unencrypt data that has already been transmitted over the air
