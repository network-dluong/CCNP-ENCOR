## Two-Tier Design (Collapsed Core)
* Collapses the core function into the distribution layer, cost-effective solution that requires no sacrifice of most of the benefits of three-tier
* Distribution/core layer provides connectivity to WAN edge block, Internet edge block, network services block, etc., LAN aggregation to end-user access layer
* WAN edge block connects to remote data centers, remote branches, campus networks, or for cloud connectivity to cloud providers using dedicated interconnections
* Data center/server room block is where business-critical servers are placed to serve up websites, corporate email, business applications, storage, big data processing, etc.
* Internet edge block used for regular Internet access, e-commerce, connection to remote branches, remote VPN access, and cloud provider connectivity that does not require dedicated interconnections
* Network service edge is where devices providing network services reside (wireless LAN controllers WLC, Cisco Identity Services Engine ISE, Cisco Unified Communications Manager CUCM)


## Three-Tier Design
* Separates the core and distribution layers, with multiple pairs of distribution switches
* Implementing network for large enterprise campus composed of multiple buildings, where each require a dedicated distribution layer
* Density of WAN routers, Internet edge devices, data center servers, and network services are overgrowing and affecting network performance
* Geographic dispersion of LAN access switches across many buildings in larger campus facility that requires more fiber-optic interconnects back to a single collapsed core
* When multiple distribution layers need to be interconnected, a core layer is necessary


## Layer 2 Access Layer (STP Based)
* Loop-free design – restricts a VLAN to a single switch, but at the cost of network flexibility because hosts within a VLAN are restricted to a single access switch. Does not support spanning VLANs across multiple access switches
* Looped design – causes STP to block links, which reduces bandwidth from the network and can cause slower network convergence
* Distribution layer should have a pair of standalone switches with FHRPs to provide hosts with consistent MAC address and gateway IP address for each configured VLAN
* HSRP and VRRP – only allow hosts to send data out to active FHRP through a single uplink, leaving one of the access layer-to-distribution layer uplinks unutilized
* GLBP provides greater uplink utilization for access layer-to-distribution layer traffic by load balancing from hosts across multiple uplinks, but works only on loop-free


## Layer 3 Access Layer (Routed Access)
* Layer 3 is extended all the way to the access layer switches, which act as full Layer 3 routed nodes (providing both Layer 2 and Layer 3 switching)
* Access-to-distribution Layer 2 uplink trunks replaced with Layer 3 point-to-point routed links
* Layer 2/3 demarcation point moved from distribution switch to access switch
* Benefits: No FHRP required, No STP required, Increased uplink utilization, Easier troubleshooting, Faster convergence
* Does not support spanning VLANs across multiple access switches


## Simplified Campus Design
* Switch clustering such as Virtual Switching System (VSS) and stacking technologies such as StackWise (multiple physical switches act as a single logical switch)
* Benefits: Simplified design, No FHRP required, Reduced STP dependence, Increased uplink utilization, Easier troubleshooting, Faster convergence, Distributed VLANs
* Loop free, high availability, flexible, resilient, and easy to manage


## Fabric Network
* Overlay network (virtual) built over an underlay network (physical) using overlay tunneling technologies such as VXLAN
* SD-Access for campus networks, SD-WAN for WAN networks


## SD-Access Fabric Concepts
* Virtual Network (VN) - provides virtualization at device level, using VRF instances to create multiple Layer 3 routing tables. Provides segmentation across IP addresses. In control plane, LISP instance IDs are used to maintain separate VRF instances. In data plane, edge nodes add VXLAN VNID to fabric encapsulation
* Host pool – group of endpoints assigned to an IP pool subnet in SDA fabric
* Scalable group – group of endpoints with similar policies. Direct one-to-one relationship between host pools and scalable groups
* Anycast gateway – provides a pervasive Layer 3 default gateway where the same SVI is provisioned on every edge node with the same SVI IP and MAC address. Simplifies IP address assignment and allowing fewer but larger IP subnets to be deployed. Behaves like a logical switch that spans multiple buildings
