#### FHRP (First-Hop Redundancy Protocol)
* Creates a virtual IP (VIP) gateway instance that is shared between Layer 3 devices
* Deployed for reliability and high availability to ensure load balancing and failover capability in case of router failover
* Object tracking – users can track specific objects in network and take necessary action when any object’s state change affects network traffic
> **Track (*object-number*) ip route (*route/prefix-length*) reachability** 
> **show track (*object-number*)**


#### HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol)
* Cisco proprietary protocol that provides transparent failover of first-hop device, which acts as a gateway to the hosts
* Provides routing redundancy for IP hosts on an Ethernet network configured with a default gateway IP address
* Minimum of two devices: one acts as active and forwards packets, the other acts as standby
* Does not support preemption by default, so it does not transfer active status to superior router
1. Define HSRP instance
> **standby (*id*) ip (*vip-address*)**
2. (Optional) Configure HSRP router preemption
> **standby (*id*) preempt**
3. (Optional) Define HSRP priority, value between 0 and 255 
> **standby (*id*) priority (*#*)**
4. (Optional) Define MAC Address
> **standby (*id*) mac-address (*address*)**
5. (Optional) Define HSRP timers (intervals of 1 to 254 seconds, or 15 to 999 milliseconds)
> **standby (*id*) timers {(*seconds*) | msec (*milliseconds*)}**
6. (Optional) Establish HSRP authentication
> **standby (*id*) authentication {(*text-password*) | text (*text-password*) | md5 {key-chain (*chain*) | key-string (*string*)}}**
> **Show standby (int-id) brief**


#### VRRP (Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol)
* Industry standard and slightly different to HSRP:
1. Master router – preferred active router controlling VIP gateway
2. Backup router – all other VRRP routers
3. Enable preemption by default
4. MAC address of VIP gateway uses structure 0000.5e00.01xx (xx is group ID in hex)
5. Use multicast address 224.0.0.18
6. VRRPv2 – supports IPv4, VRRPv3 – supports IPv4 and IPv6
  
#### Legacy VRRP:
1. Define VRRP instance
> **vrrp (*id*) ip (*vip-address*)**
2. (Optional) Define VRRP priority (0 to 255)
> **vrrp (*id*) priority (*#*)**
3. (Optional) Enable object tracking so priority is decremented when object is false
> **vrrp (*id*) track (*object-id*) decrement (*#*)**
4. (Optional) Establish VRRP authentication
> **vrrp (*id*) authentication {(*text-password*) | text (*password*) | md5 {key-chain (*chain*) | key-string (*string*)}}**

#### Hierarchical VRRP:
1. Enable VRRPv3
> **fhrp version vrrp v3**
2. Define VRRP instance
> **vrrp (*id*) address-family [ipv4 | ipv6]**
3. (Optional) Change VRRP to Version 2(V2 and V3 not compatible)
> **vrrpv2**
4. Define gateway VIP
> **address (*ip*)**
5. (Optional) Define VRRP priority between 0 and 255
> **priority (*#*)**
6. (Optional) enable object tracking
> **track (*id*) decrement (*value*)**


#### GLBP (Global Load Balancing Protocol)
* Provides gateway redundancy and load-balancing capability to network segment
* Provides redundancy with active/standby gateway, load-balancing by ensuring each member of GLBP group takes care of forwarding traffic to appropriate gateway
* Active Virtual Gateway (AVG) – routers elect one AVG per GLBP group to respond to initial ARP for VIP
* Active Virtual Forwarder (AVF) – routes traffic received from assigned hosts. Unique MAC address is created and assigned by AVG to AVFs. AVF assigned to host when AVG replies to ARP with the assigned AVF’s virtual MAC address
* Supports four active AVFs and one AVG per GLBP group, and router can be AVG and AVF simultaneously
1. Define GLBP instance
> **glbp (*id*) ip (*vip-address*)**
2. (Optional) configure GLBP preemption
> **glbp (*id*) preempt**
3. (Optional) Define GLBP priority between 0 and 255
> **glbp (*id*) priority (*#*)**
4. (Optional) Define GLBP timers
> **glbp (*id*) timers {(*hello-seconds*) | msec (*hello-milliseconds*)} {(*hold-seconds*) | msec (*hold-milliseconds*)}**
5. (Optional) establish GLBP authentication
> **glbp (*id*) authentication {text (*password*) | md5 {key-chain (*chain*) | key-string (*string*)}}**
6. Round robin configured by default (can be Weighted, Host dependent)
> **glbp (*id*) load-balancing {host-dependent | round-robin | weighted}**


#### SSO (Stateful Switchover)
* Redundancy feature that allows Cisco router with two RPs (route processor) to synchronize router configuration and control plane state information
* Checkpointing – process of mirroring information between RPs
* Standby RP immediately takes control and prevents basic problems, but layer 3 packet forward is disrupted without additional configuration
* RP switchover triggers routing protocol adjacency flap that clear route table
* When route table is cleared, CEF entries are purged, and traffic is no longer routed until network topology is relearned and forwarding table is reprogrammed
* Enabling nonstop forwarding (NSF) or nonstop routing (NSR) high availability capabilities informs the routers to maintain CEF entries for short duration and continue forwarding packets through an RP failure until control plane recovers
