### SD-Access Control Plane  
* Based on LISP – eliminates the need for each router to process every possible IP destination address and route  


### SD-Access Fabric Data Plane  
* Based on VXLAN – encapsulation is IP/UDP based, means that it can be forwarded by any IP-based network and creates overlay network for the fabric  
* Does not use LISP data for encapsulation because VXLAN encapsulation is capable of encapsulating the original Ethernet header to perform MAC-in-IP encapsulation and LISP is not capable  
* Supports Layer 2 and 3 virtual topologies and operate over any IP-based network with built-in network segmentation and built-in group-based policy  


### SD-Access Fabric Policy Plane  
* Based on Cisco TrustSec – SGT tags are assigned to authenticated groups of users or end devices  
* Network policy applied throughout fabric, based on SGT tag instead of a network address  


### SD-Access Fabric Roles and Components  
* Control plane mode – contains settings, protocols, and mapping tables to provide EID-to-RLOC mapping system for the fabric overlay. LISP map server/resolver (MS/MR), maps all EID locations to current fabric edge or border node, capable of multiple EID lookup types. Must be Cisco switch or router operating either inside or outside SD-WAN fabric  
* Fabric border mode – connects external Layer 3 networks to SDA fabric. LISP proxy tunnel routers (PxTRs) that connect external Layer 3 networks to SDA fabric and translate reachability and policy information from one domain to another  
  * Internal border (rest of company) - connects only to known areas of organization  
  * Default border (outside) - connects only to unknown areas outside organization. Configured with a default route to reach external unknown networks such as the Internet or public cloud  
  * Internal + default border (anywhere) - connects transit areas and known areas of the company  
* Fabric edge mode – connects wired endpoints to SDA fabric. LISP tunnel router (xTR) that also provides anycast gateway, endpoint authentication, and assignment to overlay host pools, as well as group-based policy enforcement  
* Fabric WLAN controller (WLC) - connects APs and wireless endpoints to SDA fabric. Connects through an internal border node, provides onboarding and mobility services. Performs PxTR registrations and can be fabric edge for wireless clients. Wireless control plane is centralized, but data plane is distributed using VXLAN directly from fabric-enabled APs instead of CAPWAP tunnel  
* Intermediate nodes – intermediate routers or extended switches that do not provide any sort of SDA fabric role other than underlay services
