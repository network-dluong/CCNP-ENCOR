## Multicast Protocols  
* Multicast traffic provides one-to-many communication, where only one data packet is sent on a link as needed and then replicated between links as the data forks on a network device along the multicast distribution tree (MDT)  
* Data packets – stream, special destination IP address – group address  
* Recipient devices of multicast stream – receivers  


## Multicast Addressing  
* IP Class D 224.0.0.0/4 (224.0.0.0 – 239.255.255.255)  
  * Local network control block (224.0.0.0/24) – used for protocol control traffic that is not forwarded out a broadcast domain  
  * Internetwork control block (224.0.1.0/24) – used for protocol control traffic that may be forwarded through the Internet  
  * Source Specific Multicast (SSM) block (232.0.0.0/8) – default ranged used my SSM, which is a PIM extension. SSM forwards traffic to receivers from only those multicast sources for which receivers have explicitly expressed interest, one-to-many  
  * GLOP block (233.0.0.0/8) – globally scoped statistically assigned addresses  
  * Administratively scoped block (239.0.0.0/8) – limited to a local group or organization

## Layer 2 Multicast Addresses  
* First 24 bits of multicast MAC address start with 01:00:5E  
  * Low-order bit of first byte is the individual/group bit (I/G) bit, or unicast/multicast bit  
  * 32 (2^5) multicast IP addresses that are not universally unique and could correspond to a single MAC address
