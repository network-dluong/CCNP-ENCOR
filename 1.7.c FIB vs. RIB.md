### FIB (Forwarding Information Base)  
* Built directly from routing table and contains next-hop IP address for each destination in the network  
* Keeps mirror image of forwarding information contained in IP routing table  
* When routing or topology change occurs, the IP routing table is updated, and changes are reflected in FIB  
* CEF uses FIB to make IP destination prefix-based switching decisions  


### RIB (Routing Information Base)  
* Built from information obtained from dynamic routing protocols, directly connected, and static routes  
* ARP table build from information obtained from ARP protocol
