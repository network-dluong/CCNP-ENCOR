### SD-Access 
* Contains four layers: Physical, Network, Underlay, Overlay  
* Network Automation – single point of automation, orchestration, and management of network functions through Cisco DNA Center  
* Network assurance and analytics – uses telemetry to improve performance of network, endpoints, and applications, including encrypted traffic  
* Host mobility – both wired and wireless clients  
* Identity services – ISE identifies users and devices connecting to network and provides contextual information required for users and devices to implement security policies for network access control and network segmentation  
* Policy enforcement – Security Group ACL (SGACL) provides simpler and scalable form of enforcement based on identity instead of IP address  
* Secure segmentation – easier to segment network to support guest, corporate, facilities, and IoT-enabled infrastructure  
*Network virtualization – leverage single physical infrastructure to support multiple virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) instances, or virtual networks (VNs), each with a distinct set of access policies  
* Cisco Campus fabric solution – includes all features and protocols to operate network infrastructure. Managed using CLI or an API using NETCONF/YANG
