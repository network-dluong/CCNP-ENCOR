### VXLAN (Virtual Extensible LAN)  
* UDP port 4789; Linux is 8472  
* Extends Layer 2 and Layer 3 overlay networks over a Layer 3 underlay network (L2 extended anywhere in IP network)  
* L2 Segment Elasticity over L3 Boundary - VXLAN encapsulates an L2 frame in an IP-UDP header, which allows L2 adjacency across router boundaries  
* Uses MAC-in-UDP encapsulation  
* 16M VNIs (VXLAN Network Identifier, broadcast domains) vs 4K traditional VLANs  
* VLAN Scalability - VXLAN extends the L2 Segment ID field to 24-bits, which potentially allows up to 16 million unique L2 segments over the same network  
* Virtual Tunnel Endpoints (VTEPs) - originate or terminate VXLAN tunnels, maps Layer 2 and Layer 3 packets to the VNI to be used in overlay network. Local LAN interface, IP interface  
* Leverages multicast in the transport network to simulate flooding behavior for broadcast, unknown unicast, and multicast in the L2 segment  
* Leverage Equal Cost Multi-pathing (ECMP) to achieve optimal path usage over the transport network
