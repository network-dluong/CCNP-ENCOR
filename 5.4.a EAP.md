## Authenticating with EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol)  
* EAP defines a set of common functions that actual authentication methods can use to authenticate users  
* Can integrate with IEEE 802.1x port-based access control standard. When 802.1x is enabled, it limites access to a network medium until a client authenticates  
* Client uses Open Authentication to associated with AP, and the actual client authentication process occurs at a dedicated authentication server  
  * Supplicant - client device requests access  
  * Authenticator - network devices provides access to network (WLC)  
  * Authentication Server (AS) - device that takes user or client credentials and permits/denies network access based on a user database and policies (RADIUS)  
* When using EAP and 802.1x, leverage the enterprise modes of WPA, WPA2, and WPA3  
* Can configure EAP-based authentication with external RADIUS servers, or EAP-based authentication with local EAP
