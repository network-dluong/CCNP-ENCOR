## Static Routes  
* **Directly Attached Static Routes**:  
  * uses only the outbound next-hop interface and requires that the outbound interface is in an up state  
> **ip route (*network*) (*subnet-mask*) (*next-hop-int-id*)**  
* **Recursive Static Routes**:  
  * Specifies the IP address of the next-hop address  
  * Router queries RIB to locate the route toward the next-hop IP address and cross-references the adjacency table  
> **ip route (*network*) (*subnet-mask*) (*next-hop-ip-address*)**  
* **Fully Specified Static Routes**:   
  * static route with both an outside interface and a next-hop IP address  
> **ip route (*network*) (*subnet-mask*) (*int-id*) (*next-hop-ip-address*)**  
* **Floating Static Routing**:  
  * common technique for providing backup connectivity for prefixes learned via dynamic routing protocols  
  * Configured with an AD higher than primary route  
> **ip route (*network*) (*subnet-mask*) (*next-hop-int-id*) (*#*)**  
* **Static Null Routes**:  
  * Null interface – virtual interface that is always in up-state. Does not forward or receive network traffic and drops all traffic destined toward them without adding overhead to router’s CPU  
  * Configuring static route to null interface provides method of dropping network traffic without requiring configuration of an access list  
  * Prevents routing loops  
* **IPv6 Static Routes**:  
  * Enable IPv6 routing:  
> **ipv6 unicast routing**  
  * **IPv6 static route**:  
> **ipv6 route (*network/prefix length*) {(*next-hop-int-id*) | (*next-hop-int-id*) (*next-hop-ip-address*)}**  
> **show ipv6 route**
