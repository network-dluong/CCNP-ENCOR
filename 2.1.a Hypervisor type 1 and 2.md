## Type 1 Hypervisor  
* Bare metal, runs directly on host machine’s physical hardware  
* Highly secure: attack surface of underlying OS is eliminated, ensures logical isolation of every guest VM against malicious software and activity  
* VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V server, open source KVM  

## Type 2 Hypervisor  
* Hosted hypervisor: installed on top of existing OS, relies on host machine’s pre-existing OS to manage calls to CPU, memory, storage, and network resources  
* Not used for data center computing, reserved for client or end-user systems (client hypervisor)  
* VMware Fusion, VMware Workstation, Oracle VM VirtualBox
