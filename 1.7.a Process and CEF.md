### Process Switching (software switching; slow path)  
* Switching mechanism in which the general-purpose CPU on router oversees packet switching  
* Fallback for CEF because it is dedicated to processing punted IP packets when they cannot be switched by CEF  
* Types of packets requiring software handling:  
  * Packets sourced or destined to router (using control traffic or routing protocols)  
  * Packets that are too complex for hardware to handle (IP packets with IP options)  
  * Packets that require extra information that is not currently known (ARP)  


### CEF (Cisco Express Forwarding)  
* Switching mechanism that use specialized application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) and network processing units (NPUs) for high packet throughput (hardware-based routers)  
* Software-based routers – general-purpose CPU oversees all operations (software CEF)  
* Hardware-based routers – CEF switching using forwarding engines that are implemented in specialized ASICs, TCAM, and NPUs  
* Software CEF (software FIB) - contains FIB and adjacency table (AIB)  
* Hardware CEF – distributed CEF (dCEF), mechanism in which CEF data structures are downloaded to forwarding ASICs and the CPUs of all line cards so they can participate in packet switching
